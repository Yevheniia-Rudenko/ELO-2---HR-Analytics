# 🌟 HR Analytics — ELO2 Project (MIT Emerging Talent)

[![CI Checks](https://github.com/Yevheniia-Rudenko/ELO-2---HR-Analytics/workflows/CI%20Checks/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Yevheniia-Rudenko/ELO-2---HR-Analytics/actions)

This repository contains the **HR Analytics project**, developed as part of the **MIT Emerging Talent ELO2 module**.  
The project explores the **HR Analytics industry**, focusing on **modern analytical approaches, data-driven insights, and the implementation of machine learning and cloud technologies**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The **HR Analytics** initiative aims to analyze key trends and technologies shaping the HR analytics field today.  
Together **Yevheniia Rudenko** and **Oleksandr Maksymikhin** will explore and apply different **data analysis methodologies**, **ML techniques**, and **cloud-based solutions (such as Google Cloud Platform - GCP)** to understand how data can empower HR decision-making and workforce optimization.

Our focus includes:

- Investigating **current HR analytics practices and their real-world applications**  
- Implementing **predictive and descriptive models** using Python and popular data science libraries  
- Exploring **cloud technologies** (GCP, BigQuery, etc.) for scalable data storage and computation  
- Experimenting with **visualization and dashboarding tools** for effective communication of insights
